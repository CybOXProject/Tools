CybOX XML to HTML transform v2.0beta1
Compatible with CybOX v2.0

This is an xslt to transform a cybox 2.0 document of observables into html for
easy viewing.  The series of observables are turned into collapsible elements
on the screen.  Details about each observable's contents are displayed in a
format representing the nested structure of the original document.

Below the main observable, Object, Event, and Observable_Composition are
displayed.  For composite observables, the nested structure of the composition
and the logical relationships is displayed via nested tables with operators
("and" and "or) on the left and then a series of component expressions on rows
on the right.

Any time objects are referred to by reference, they can be expanded in-line.

Supports:
- Observable, Observable_Composition
- Object
- Related_Object
- Associated_Object
- Event
- cybox:Properties:
  * direct children of cybox:Properties will be printed with the localname of
    the element as the property "name", the text value of the element as the
    "value", and the attributes as "constraints".
  * specific templates can be created for Properties that need more detailed
    formatting
  * the following elements have specialized formatting:
    - EmailMessageObj:Header, FileObj:*

Warning about cybox properties:
  The general template that is applied will use the localname of the element
  that is a direct child of cybox:Properties, the value is the text value of
  this element (meaning all the text nodes of descendants are concatenated),
  and the constraints column shows all attributes on this same element.
  
  Any element that contains richer structured content will probably need a
  custom template created.

This is a work in progress.  Feedback is most welcome!

requirements:
 - XSLT 2.0 engine; we strongly encourage the use of Saxon 9.x: http://saxon.sourceforge.net/, which we have been using for testing.
 - a CybOX 2.0 input xml document
